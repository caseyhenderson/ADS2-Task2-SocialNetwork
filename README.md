# ADS2-Task2-SocialNetwork
This assignment was Task 2 for my Algorithms and Data Structures project, for which I had to replicate aspects of a social network using hash maps and pairs in Java. In this project, I also used adjacency matrices and a modified Dijkstra's algorithm for calculating the shortest path.
