# ADS2-Task2-SocialNetwork
This assignment was Task 2 for my Algorithms and Data Structures II project, for which I had to replicate aspects of a social network using hash maps and pairs in Java. In this project, I also used adjacency matrices and a modified Dijkstra's algorithm for calculating the shortest path - more info can be found in the Profiling Report. 

This project was my second assignment for my Algorithms and Data Structures II module in second year. I received a grade of 81 (First) for this work, which was completed in May 2021.
